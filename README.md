# scripts
I've been trying to learn more about bash scripting.
Formatting wise my scripts may differ wildly from each other.
Each one has been wrote to serve a purpose for my setup.

If anyone happens to stumble on this repo feel free to give suggestions or advise.
I would really appreciate it. Thank you
